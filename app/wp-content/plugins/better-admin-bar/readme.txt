Admin bar floating on the top. Hide admin bar or set its opacity.

== Description ==

Admin bar moves your website 32px down by default, but now it doesn't. This plugin was developed, because sometimes when you're using absolute positions, admin bar causes problems with top positioning.

<ul>
	<li>hide admin bar for all users</li>
	<li>hide admin bar for all users except administrators</li>
	<li>hide admin bar on smaller screens</li>
	<li>set opacity of admin bar</li>
	<li>set opacity of admin bar on hover</li>
	<li>set auto-hide and show on hover</li>
	<li>set hover delay</li>
</ul>

== Installation ==

1. Upload `better-admin-bar` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Manage your settings in 'Settings >> Better Admin Bar'
